@KenyaPower_Care @KenyaPower Not entirely as my next door neighbors that had reported an outage that occurred last night around 9pm are still in darkness. Their issues relate to ref. no.  5918711. Appears to be the persistent phase failures relating to ths transformer supply out block of apartments.

@KenyaPower_Care I have inboxed you but still no response to my queries. Kindly check DM

@KenyaPower_Care Yes it has. We had reported in the morning. The issue here is not so much the outage, but the frequency. That USSD shortcode is good, it it's not good for us to have to use it every other day. Thanks though.
