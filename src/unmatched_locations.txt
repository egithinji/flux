Kenya power usually claim they are making losses.i have three pre paid meters which have not been working  for long  and I have raised this issue countless  times  and even going to ruaraka to  complain without  any assistance. Am very frustrated. 37124936420
***** 
@KenyaPower @KenyaPower_Care sent someone to check where the hold up is for a reconnection: R2470201000003 for meter number 40703171. Ugunja office team had the audacity to hand over a fuse to the young man to go get connection done on his own!!
***** 
@JerotichSeii @KenyaPower @KenyaPower_Care It sickens me whenever I hear the name of this utility firm. They do things with alot of impunity just because they enjoy Monopoly. Illegal connections and inflated bills is their trademark. Very shameful.
